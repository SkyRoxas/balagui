        p Soybean export in April is the highest in the country's economic history
        p In April of this year, Paraguay exported 897,224 tons of soybeans, for which they entered 441.7 million dollars. Both figures are the highest since official records exist.
        p Paraguay's soybean exports totaled 897,224 tons and represented revenues of 441.7 million dollars last April, according to the Central Bank's foreign trade data.
          | <br>These figures are the highest since there is an official record (1994) and of the economic history of Paraguay itself, since in the previous years, neither the planting area nor the technology were the ones currently available, as for suppose that the mentioned numbers could be overcome.
          | <br> With the data of April, the first quarter of the year recorded 1.432 million dollars of income only for exports of the oilseed by a volume of 3.06 million tons, which implies an expansion of 21.6% in terms of foreign currency and of 29.5% in tons.
          | <br> Soy is the first export item in the country, with a 39% share in the total basket of shipments from Paraguay to the world.
          | <br> However, despite this level of foreign exchange generated by soy and in recent months also its industrialized derivatives (flour and oils), its contribution to the State coffers is laughable compared to all the money generated by the soy business in terms of currencies, according to criticism from the Ministry of Finance.
          | <br> The income tax on agricultural activities (Imagro) contributed to the treasury 15.9 million dollars last year, equivalent to 0.9% of the total collected in tax concept.
          | <br> Several sectors have criticized the scarce contribution of the agricultural sector to the country, either in the amount of income for the State or in the creation of jobs.
          | <br> On the other hand, those who claim the agro-export model point out the importance of foreign currency income to maintain the exchange rate at current levels, in addition to the indirect economic movement generated by the agricultural circuit and more recently the agro-industry.
          | <br> In this regard, it should be mentioned that flour exports have also recorded a record of 336,520 tons and 161.4 million dollars in April, volumes that are growing as the processing of raw materials progresses. Between January and April, they already accumulate 388.3 million dollars and 806,304 tons exported, always in accordance with official records.
          | <br> TOTAL. Total exports of Paraguay at the end of the first four months of the year reached 3,640 million dollars, 15.5% more than in the same period of 2013.
          | <br> The items that expanded the most in terms of foreign exchange during the first four months of 2014 are flour, with 94% more; oils, with 32%.
          | <br> Already behind these and the soybean (21.6%), the meat observed an increase of 17%, at the end of the fourth month of the year, entering 357.9 million dollars for this concept.
